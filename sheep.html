    Sheep (pl: sheep) or domestic sheep (Ovis aries) are a domesticated, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. <br>
     Although the term sheep can apply to other species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to domesticated sheep. <br>
     Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. <br>
    An adult female is referred to as a ewe, an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep as a lamb.

<p>
    Elephants are the largest living land animals. <br> 
    Three living species are currently recognised: <ol>
        <li>the African bush elephant</li>
        <li>the African forest elephant</li>
        <li>and the Asian elephant</li>
        </ol>  
     They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. <br> 
     Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. <br>
    The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. <br>
     Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. <br>
      The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. <br>
       African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.
